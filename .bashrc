#  executable
#  block special
#  character special
#  executable with setuid bit set

# They are set in pairs, foreground (f) then background (b),
# i.e. fbfbfbfbfbfbfbfbfbfbfb for all 11 settings. 
# The default is exfxcxdxbxegedabagacad, i.e. blue foreground and 
# default background for regular directories, 
# black foreground and red background for setuid executables, etc.
